      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi! My name is Wangui Iruku, but I go by Kui. My parents are from Kenya and I have lived in Georgia my entire life. I go to the Georgia Institute of Technology and my major is computer science.</p>
      <h3>How I Got Into Computer Science</h3>
      <p>When I was a sophomore in high school, I visited my sister during her six-week summer program at Carnegie Mellon University. While there, I saw another program called the National High School Game Academy and I thought it was so cool that I applied for it the next year. I participated in the program the summer of my junior year and I really enjoyed learning how to code, working on teams, and creating video games from scratch. In the fall of my senior year, I took my very first computer science course and knew for certain that I wanted to study it in college. I later applied to Georgia Tech as a CS major. </p>
