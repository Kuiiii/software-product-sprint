      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi! My name is Wangui Iruku, but I go by Kui. My parents are from Kenya and I have lived in Georgia my entire life. I go to the Georgia Institute of Technology and my major is computer science.</p>
      <h3>How I Got Into Computer Science</h3>
      <p>When I was a sophomore in high school, I visited my sister during her six-week summer program at Carnegie Mellon University. While there, I saw another program called the National High School Game Academy and I thought it was so cool that I applied for it the next year. I participated in the program the summer of my junior year and I really enjoyed learning how to code, working on teams, and creating video games from scratch. In the fall of my senior year, I took my very first computer science course and knew for certain that I wanted to study it in college. I later applied to Georgia Tech as a CS major. </p>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <h5>Spectrum</h5>
      <p>Spectrum is a virtual reality puzzle game where the player uses portals to bring objects between three colored worlds and solve puzzles. I spent over 120 hours in total working on Spectrum during the summer program I participated in at Carnegie Mellon University. I spent my time making the art and designing the puzzles for it. I worked with a team of four other people diligently to complete the game, and afterwards, presented it in an auditorium to an audience of over 70 people. Through my accomplishments in this program I was able to learn a great deal.</p>

      <h5>Breakfast Time</h5>
      <p>On the third week of the summer program I participated in at Carnegie Mellon University, we were assigned to teams, and I was made an artist and a producer. The task was to recreate an assigned classic arcade game and while maintaining its crucial mechanics, to give it a new theme and try to improve the game over all in only one week. Under my direction, my team and I made the arcade game Burger Time into our own version, Breakfast Time. As a producer, I made a schedule for my team to follow, set deadlines to ensure everything was working on time, solved conflicts, created instructional documents for my team, and organized the culmination of the final product. Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the finished product my team was able to make in such limited time.</p>
